<DIV align="justify">
  
Welcome!

I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. 

My research interests include time series econometrics, Bayesian analysis, panel data models, applied macroeconomics, and machine learning. Much of my work focus on  econometric forecasting. 

I'm working on forecasting with dynamic panel data models. In particular, I develop a Bayesian grouped estimator that leverages prior information on the latent constant group structure to assist forecasting. It is an exciting topic that involves panel data model estimation and semi-supervised learning.
