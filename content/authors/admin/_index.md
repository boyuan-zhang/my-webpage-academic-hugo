<DIV align="justify">
  
Welcome!!

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. 

My research interests include time series econometrics, Bayesian analysis, panel data models, applied macroeconomics, and machine learning. The majority of my work involves econometric forecasting. My most recent projects are focused on grouped heterogeneity in dynamic panel data models. In particular, I'm interested in bringing prior knowledge on the latent group structure into the model and explore the predictive gain over prevailing estimators for panel data models. It is an exciting topic that involves panel data model estimation and semi-supervised learning.
